# blokus

Implementation of the [Blokus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus) game.
You can play from 2 to 4 players place and rotate pieces

This was developped to work on a Windows terminal but unix support has been added (but not widely tested)
The save feature is not working, the goal was to save the game in a file as small as possible
